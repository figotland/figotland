Welcome to Feministiskt Initiativ Gotland! We work for an equal and sustainable island and world. We started in 2006 and work with feminist politics in different ways. We strive to be inclusive of all people, and welcome everyone regardless of citizenship and background. Our meetings are usually in Swedish, but we can always organize translation to English, and most of us understand English.

If you want to know more or feel like getting active â€“ [contact us](http://figotland.se/kontakt), [visit us](https://goo.gl/maps/bf49esEskBG2) or [become a member](http://feministisktinitiativ.se/bli-medlem/). That way you are sure to get all information about what is going on by mail!
